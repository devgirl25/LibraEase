# Notification System - Quick Setup Guide

## What's Been Added

### New Files Created:
1. `lib/services/notification_manager.dart` - Core notification service
2. `lib/services/notification_scheduler.dart` - Automated notification scheduler
3. `lib/screens/studenthomepage/notifications_page_enhanced.dart` - Enhanced notifications UI
4. `NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM.md` - Complete documentation

### Modified Files:

2. `lib/screens/studenthomepage/home_page.dart` - Added notification badge counter
3. `lib/main.dart` - Initialized notification scheduler

## Features Implemented

### âœ… 12 Notification Types
1. Due Date Reminders (3 days, 1 day, day of due date)
2. Overdue Book Alerts (daily after due date)
3. Borrow Success Notifications
4. Borrow Approved/Rejected Notifications
5. Book Renewed Notifications
6. Book Returned Notifications
7. Registration Approved/Rejected Notifications
8. New Book Available Notifications
9. Wishlist Book Available Notifications
10. Library Announcements

### âœ… UI Features
- **Notification Badge**: Red badge on home page navigation showing unread count
- **Swipe to Delete**: Swipe left on notifications to delete
- **Mark as Read**: Tap to mark individual notifications as read
- **Mark All as Read**: Button to mark all notifications as read
- **Delete All**: Option to delete all notifications
- **Notification Icons**: Different colored icons for each notification type
- **Relative Timestamps**: Shows "5m ago", "2h ago", etc.
- **Action Buttons**: Contextual actions like "Renew Book", "Borrow Now"

### âœ… Automated Scheduler
- Checks for due date reminders every 6 hours
- Checks for overdue books every 12 hours
- Runs initial check on app start
- Prevents duplicate notifications

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Notifications (Already Working)
When students borrow, renew, or return books through the app, notifications are automatically sent via the `BorrowService`.

```dart
// Example: When a student borrows a book
await borrowService.borrowBook(
  bookId: 'book123',
  bookTitle: 'Clean Code',
  userId: 'user123',
  borrowDays: 14,
);
// âœ… Automatically sends "Book Borrowed Successfully" notification
```

### 2. Scheduled Notifications (Background)
The `NotificationScheduler` automatically checks for:
- Books due in 3 days â†’ Sends reminder
- Books due in 1 day â†’ Sends urgent reminder
- Books due today â†’ Sends final reminder
- Books overdue â†’ Sends overdue alert (daily)

### 3. Badge Counter (Real-time)
The home page navigation bar shows a red badge with the count of unread notifications. It updates in real-time as notifications are read or received.

## Testing the Notification System

### Test Scenario 1: Manual Notification
```dart
// Add this code temporarily in any page to test
import '../../services/notification_manager.dart';

final notificationManager = NotificationManager();

// Test button
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    await notificationManager.sendLibraryAnnouncementNotification(
      userId: FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser!.uid,
      title: 'Test Notification',
      message: 'This is a test notification to verify the system is working!',
    );
  },
  child: const Text('Send Test Notification'),
)
```

### Test Scenario 2: Due Date Reminder
1. Create a borrowed book in Firestore with a due date 3 days from now:
```javascript
// In Firestore Console
users/{userId}/borrow_history
{
  "bookId": "test123",
  "bookTitle": "Test Book",
  "borrowDate": <today>,
  "dueDate": <3 days from now>,
  "status": "borrowed"
}
```
2. Wait for scheduler to run (6 hours) OR trigger manual check:
```dart
await NotificationScheduler().runManualCheck();
```
3. Check notifications page - should see due date reminder

### Test Scenario 3: Overdue Book
1. Create a borrowed book with past due date:
```javascript
users/{userId}/borrow_history
{
  "bookId": "test123",
  "bookTitle": "Overdue Test Book",
  "borrowDate": <10 days ago>,
  "dueDate": <3 days ago>,
  "status": "borrowed"
}
```
2. Trigger manual check or wait for scheduler
3. Should receive overdue notification

### Test Scenario 4: Badge Counter
1. Send multiple notifications (use test scenario 1)
2. Go to home page - check navigation bar
3. Badge should show count of unread notifications
4. Tap notifications icon, mark some as read
5. Badge count should decrease automatically

## Admin: Sending Bulk Notifications

To send announcements to all students:

```dart
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';
import '../services/notification_manager.dart';

Future<void> sendAnnouncementToAllStudents({
  required String title,
  required String message,
}) async {
  final notificationManager = NotificationManager();
  final firestore = FirebaseFirestore.instance;

  // Get all students
  final usersSnapshot = await firestore
      .collection('users')
      .where('role', isEqualTo: 'student')
      .get();

  // Send notification to each student
  for (var userDoc in usersSnapshot.docs) {
    await notificationManager.sendLibraryAnnouncementNotification(
      userId: userDoc.id,
      title: title,
      message: message,
    );
  }
}

// Usage:
await sendAnnouncementToAllStudents(
  title: 'Library Closed Tomorrow',
  message: 'The library will be closed tomorrow for maintenance.',
);
```

## Firestore Security Rules

Add these rules to your Firestore to secure notifications:

```javascript
// In Firebase Console > Firestore > Rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // ... existing rules ...

    match /users/{userId}/notifications/{notificationId} {
      // Students can read and update their own notifications
      allow read, update: if request.auth.uid == userId;

      // System can create notifications (via admin SDK or Cloud Functions)
      allow create: if request.auth != null;

      // Students can delete their own notifications
      allow delete: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## Optional: Using the Enhanced Notifications Page

To use the enhanced notifications page with better UI:

1. Open `lib/screens/studenthomepage/home_page.dart`
2. Find the import for `notifications_page.dart`
3. Change it to:
```dart
import 'notifications_page_enhanced.dart';
```
4. Update the navigation:
```dart
case 1:
  nextPage = NotificationsPageEnhanced(); // Instead of NotificationsPage()
  break;
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Check Notification Logs
The scheduler logs its activity to the console:
```
Starting notification scheduler...
Running initial notification check...
Checking for due date reminders...
Due date reminder check completed
```

### Manual Trigger for Testing
```dart
// Add a debug button in admin panel
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    await NotificationScheduler().runManualCheck();
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      const SnackBar(content: Text('Manual notification check completed')),
    );
  },
  child: const Text('Run Notification Check'),
)
```

### Stop Scheduler (if needed)
```dart
NotificationScheduler().stopScheduler();
```

### Check Scheduler Status
```dart
bool isRunning = NotificationScheduler().isRunning;
print('Scheduler running: $isRunning');
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Notifications not showing up
**Solution:**
1. Check if user is logged in: `FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser != null`
2. Verify Firestore rules allow reads
3. Check console for errors
4. Verify notification was created in Firestore Console

### Problem: Badge count not updating
**Solution:**
1. Restart the app to reinitialize listeners
2. Check if `_listenToNotifications()` is being called in `initState()`
3. Verify Firestore connection

### Problem: Duplicate notifications
**Solution:**
- The system prevents duplicates using `lastReminderSent` tracking
- If still occurring, check if scheduler is being started multiple times

### Problem: Scheduler not running
**Solution:**
1. Check `main.dart` has `NotificationScheduler().startScheduler()`
2. Verify Firebase is initialized before scheduler starts
3. Check console for error messages

## Production Recommendations

### 1. Use Cloud Functions
For production, implement the scheduler as Firebase Cloud Functions:
- More reliable than app-based scheduler
- Runs even when app is closed
- Better for battery life

### 2. Implement Push Notifications
Add Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for:
- Notifications when app is closed
- Better user engagement
- Immediate delivery

### 3. Add Notification Preferences
Let users customize:
- Which notification types to receive
- Notification timing preferences
- Email vs in-app notifications

### 4. Analytics
Track notification engagement:
- Open rates
- Click-through rates
- Most effective notification types
