# üöÄ Notification System - Quick Implementation Guide

## What Was Implemented

A comprehensive notification system that automatically sends students notifications for:

1. ‚úÖ **Due Date Reminders** - 3 days before book due date
2. ‚úÖ **Overdue Alerts** - Daily notifications for overdue books
3. ‚úÖ **Borrow Request Updates** - When admin approves/rejects
4. ‚úÖ **Book Renewals** - Confirmation when book is renewed
5. ‚úÖ **Visual Indicators** - Badge showing unread count on home page

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files Created:
1. `lib/services/notification_scheduler.dart` - Automated notification checker
2. `NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM.md` - Complete documentation
3. `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - This file

### Files Modified:
1. `lib/services/notificationservice.dart` - Enhanced with all notification types
2. `lib/services/borrow_service.dart` - Integrated notifications
3. `lib/main.dart` - Added scheduler initialization
4. `lib/screens/studenthomepage/home_page.dart` - Added notification badge
5. `lib/screens/studenthomepage/notifications_page.dart` - Enhanced UI with types
6. `lib/screens/studenthomepage/borrow_history_page.dart` - Added renewal notifications
7. `lib/screens/adminhomepage/managerequest.dart` - Added approval/rejection notifications

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Checks (Every Hour)
```
NotificationScheduler (runs every hour)
    ‚Üì
Checks for books due in 3 days
    ‚Üí Sends due date reminders
    
Checks for overdue books
    ‚Üí Sends overdue notifications
```

### 2. Event-Based Notifications

**When Admin Approves Request:**
```
Admin clicks "Accept"
    ‚Üì
ManageRequestPage.dart
    ‚Üì
NotificationService.sendBorrowApprovedNotification()
    ‚Üì
Student sees "Borrow Request Approved" notification
```

**When Admin Rejects Request:**
```
Admin clicks "Reject" ‚Üí Enters reason
    ‚Üì
ManageRequestPage.dart
    ‚Üì
NotificationService.sendBorrowRejectedNotification()
    ‚Üì
Student sees "Borrow Request Rejected" notification with reason
```

**When Student Renews Book:**
```
Student clicks "Renew"
    ‚Üì
BorrowHistoryPage.dart
    ‚Üì
NotificationService.sendBookRenewedNotification()
    ‚Üì
Student sees "Book Renewed" notification
```

## Key Features

### 1. Smart Reminders
- Sends reminder only once (tracks with `reminderSent` field)
- Resets when book is renewed
- Checks every hour automatically

### 2. Overdue Management
- Daily notifications for overdue books
- Shows number of days overdue
- Tracks last notification to avoid spam

### 3. Visual Feedback
- Red badge on notification bell icon
- Shows unread count (e.g., "5" or "9+")
- Color-coded notification types
- Different icons for each type

### 4. User-Friendly UI
- Tap notification to mark as read
- "Mark all as read" button
- Unread notifications highlighted
- Type-specific colors and icons

## Testing the System

### 1. Test Borrow Request Notifications

**As Student:**
```
1. Browse books
2. Click "Borrow" on a book
3. Check notifications
   ‚Üí Should see "Borrow Request Submitted"
```

**As Admin:**
```
1. Go to Borrow Requests
2. Click "Manage" on a request
3. Click "Accept"
4. Switch to student account
5. Check notifications
   ‚Üí Should see "Borrow Request Approved"
```

### 2. Test Due Date Reminder

**Setup:**
```dart
// In Firestore, create a borrow_request with:
{
  "status": "accepted",
  "dueDate": Timestamp(3 days from now),
  "reminderSent": false,
  "userId": "student_uid",
  "bookTitle": "Test Book"
}
```

**Trigger:**
```dart
// Option 1: Wait for hourly check
// Option 2: Trigger manually (add this to a debug screen)
await NotificationScheduler.instance.triggerManualCheck();
```

**Verify:**
- Check student's notifications
- Should see "Due Date Reminder" notification

### 3. Test Overdue Notification

**Setup:**
```dart
// In Firestore, create a borrow_request with:
{
  "status": "accepted",
  "dueDate": Timestamp(yesterday),
  "userId": "student_uid",
  "bookTitle": "Test Book"
}
```

**Trigger:**
```dart
await NotificationScheduler.instance.triggerManualCheck();
```

**Verify:**
- Check student's notifications
- Should see "Overdue Book" notification with days overdue

### 4. Test Book Renewal

**As Student:**
```
1. Go to Borrow History
2. Find a borrowed book
3. Click "Renew"
4. Check notifications
   ‚Üí Should see "Book Renewed" notification
```

### 5. Test Rejection with Reason

**As Admin:**
```
1. Go to Borrow Requests
2. Click "Manage" on a request
3. Click "Reject"
4. Enter reason: "Book is currently reserved"
5. Click "Reject" in dialog
6. Switch to student account
7. Check notifications
   ‚Üí Should see "Borrow Request Rejected" with reason
```

### 6. Test Notification Badge

**As Student:**
```
1. Have some unread notifications
2. Go to Home page
3. Look at notification bell icon in bottom nav
   ‚Üí Should see red badge with count
4. Tap notification bell
5. Tap a notification
6. Go back to Home
   ‚Üí Badge count should decrease
```

## Configuration Options

### Change Reminder Timing

In `lib/services/notificationservice.dart`, line ~80:
```dart
// Current: 3 days before
final threeDaysFromNow = now.add(const Duration(days: 3));

// Change to 5 days before:
final fiveDaysFromNow = now.add(const Duration(days: 5));
```

### Change Check Frequency

In `lib/services/notification_scheduler.dart`, line ~26:
```dart
// Current: every hour
_timer = Timer.periodic(const Duration(hours: 1), (timer) {

// Change to every 30 minutes:
_timer = Timer.periodic(const Duration(minutes: 30), (timer) {
```

### Change Overdue Notification Frequency

In `lib/services/notificationservice.dart`, line ~155:
```dart
// Current: once per day
shouldSendNotification = daysSinceLastNotification >= 1;

// Change to twice per day:
shouldSendNotification = 
    now.difference(lastNotificationDate).inHours >= 12;
```

```javascript
users/{userId}/notifications/{notificationId}
{
  title: string,           // "Due Date Reminder"
  message: string,         // Full message text
  type: string,            // "return_reminder", "overdue", etc.

```

### Borrow Request Fields (for notifications)
```javascript
borrow_requests/{requestId}
{
  // ... existing fields ...
  reminderSent: boolean,              // Has 3-day reminder been sent?

  rejectionReason: string             // (optional) Why was it rejected?
}
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Notifications Not Showing

**Solution:**
1. Check user is logged in
2. Verify Firestore permissions
3. Check console for errors
4. Verify scheduler is started in main.dart

### Issue: Badge Not Updating

**Solution:**
1. Ensure StreamBuilder is in HomePage
2. Check user ID is correct
3. Verify notifications collection exists
4. Check 'read' field is boolean

### Issue: Reminders Sent Multiple Times

**Solution:**
1. Check `reminderSent` field is being set to true
2. Verify field is being updated in Firestore
3. Check scheduler isn't started multiple times

### Issue: Overdue Notifications Every Hour

**Solution:**
1. Check `lastOverdueNotification` field is being updated
2. Verify the 24-hour check logic
3. Ensure Timestamp is being saved correctly

## Next Steps

1. **Test All Scenarios** - Go through each test case above
2. **Customize Timing** - Adjust reminder/check frequencies if needed
3. **Add Push Notifications** - Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging
4. **Monitor Performance** - Check Firestore read/write usage
5. **Gather Feedback** - Get user feedback on notification content
